For \n                      this reason, I made it a habit to always use a nice, professional tone (sarcasm cannot be detected through \n                      text) and be as detailed as possible to leave as little room as possible for confusion.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>Like most companies, and being a travel/vacationing company at that, many employees were laid \n                      off. Quickly, the existing employees soon found themselves doing tasks out of their role description \n                      including myself. With this change, I made it a goal to dive deeper into data analyst (our Data Analyst \n                      was laid off and her work handed over).\n                    </p>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                \n            </div>\n            </Wrapper>\n            <Footer/>\n        </div>\n        \n    )\n}\n\nexport default LaceUp;\n\nconst Wrapper = styled.section`\n\n  display: grid;\n  place-items: center;\n  margin: 0 20px;\n    .intro-container, .purpose-container, .spotlight-container, .lessons-container {\n        padding-bottom: 50px;\n    }\n    .intro-paragraph {\n      text-align: left;\n      padding-bottom: 80px;\n    }\n\n    h1 {\n      font-family: 'Anton', sans-serif;\n      font-size: 50px;\n      text-align: center;\n      text-transform: uppercase;\n      padding: 40px 0;\n      color: #CE7672;\n    }\n\n    p {\n        line-height: 25px;\n        padding-bottom: 10px;\n    }\n\n    .tech-stack {\n        padding: 20px 0;\n    }\n    .tech-stack-col {\n      display: none;\n    }\n\n    .tech-stack span {\n        color: #DC8666;\n        font-weight: 600;\n    }\n\n    .cta a {\n        text-decoration: none;\n        color: #EEB462;\n        font-weight: 500;\n        padding-right: 20px;\n    }\n\n    img {\n      width: 100%;\n      -webkit-box-shadow: 5px 5px 18px 5px #B2B2B2; \n      box-shadow: 5px 5px 18px 5px #B2B2B2;\n    }\n\n    .purpose-container h3 {\n        font-size: 25px;\n        padding-bottom: 20px;\n        text-align: right;\n        color: #138085;\n\n    }\n\n    .spotlight-container h3 {\n        font-size: 25px;\n        padding-bottom: 20px;\n        color: #138085;\n\n    }\n\n    .lessons-container h3 {\n        font-size: 25px;\n        padding-bottom: 20px;\n        text-align: right;\n        color: #138085;\n    }\n\n    .more-projects {\n        padding: 50px 0 90px 0;\n    }\n\n   \n\n    @media only screen and ${breakpoint.device.tablet} {\n        // background-color: yellow;\n\n        margin: 0 40px;\n        .intro-paragraph {\n        }\n\n        .tech-stack {\n            display: flex;\n            justify-content: space-around;\n        }\n        .cta {\n            display: flex;\n            flex-direction: column;\n            justify-content: space-around;\n        }\n\n        .snap-one-image {\n            width: 300px;\n        }\n    }\n\n    @media only screen and ${breakpoint.device.desktop} {\n        // background-color: red;\n\n        margin: 0 50px;\n\n        img {\n            width: 900px;\n            display: block;\n            margin-left: auto;\n            margin-right: auto;\n        }\n        .random {\n          display: flex;\n        }\n        .tech-stack-col {\n          display: block;\n        }\n        .tech-stack-col img{\n          width: 200px;\n      margin-right: 50px;\n        }\n\n        .tech-stack-row {\n          display: none;\n        }\n    }\n`;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
